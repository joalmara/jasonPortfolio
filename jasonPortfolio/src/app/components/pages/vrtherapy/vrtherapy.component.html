To do this, our team looked to design and build a mobile application in which users can schedule group therapy sessions through virtual reality. Users can take a free screening test - from the mental health america - with topics such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc to get feedback based on their answers from a questionnaire. Whichever results the users receive, the application will recommend different sessions in which they can enroll onto. Individuals can choose whichever sessions are convenient for them and determine the times in which they can join. Each session will be proctored by a trained psychiatrist who will guide conversation about whichever topic that is being discussed. The actual virtual reality session will then actually be utilized by a separate application known as vTime which supports group VR session through a mobile device. Users will have the option to choose their screen name and display the way look through the vTime application. In addition, each member must comply with the code of conduct that are set in place before joining a session, detailing the proper way of conversing within a group. Within these sessions individuals will meet to solve any problems, achieve any personal goals, track their emotions, improve communication and social skills and build the life they deserve.

Usually individuals in these stages of their lives deal with a considerable amount of stress due to may of life’s changes in dealing with expenses, education, romance and career oriented goals. A study done at the Center on Healthy Aging at the University of California, San Diego detailed that those that are older seemed to be satisfied with their mental health, whereas those who are in their 20s and 30s reported to have much more exposure towards higher levels of stress, depression and anxiety. In addition, the individuals who within the ages of 20 and 30s are more likely to be comfortable using new and progressive technologies to improve their wellness and we speculated that this age group would likely consider using VR technology.

This would be viewed as another alternative to help express their concerns in a much more convenient fashion than physically going to a seminar. In this day and age, it is also important to have a social media presence to help get good exposure to your brand and application to reach as many people as possible.

                  <li> Those that enter actual group therapy may feel uncomfortable sharing their thoughts and emotions with others and are unsure what type of reactions they will receive. The way in which this application looks to relive this issue is by allowing users to create their own avatars of themselves through vTime and allow them to set their own screen name so that their likeness will not be publicized. Those who may feel embarrassed who go to traditional group therapy sessions will be given the freedom to share their thoughts in a non-judgemental environment with sessions being proctored by a trained psychiatrist.

The user can easily navigate through the list of psychiatrists, information about each psychiatrist, sign up for classes, pay for classes, and edit their profile. We decided to use the ionic framework so we can easily make the app compatible with android and iOS with consistent user interface.

The profile page allows the users to change the app settings, edit profile, edit payment option, and see software terms and account privacy information.
